A `LogRecorder` implementation that stores log messages in a file.

**Note:** This implementation provides no mechanism for log file rotation
or log pruning. It is the responsibility of the developer to keep the log
file at a reasonable size. Use `DailyRotatingLogFileRecorder` instead if you'd 
rather not have to think about such details.

    - parameter     currentQueue: The GCD queue on which the function is being
                executed.

    - parameter     synchronousMode: If `true`, the receiver should record the
                log entry synchronously. Synchronous mode is used during
                debugging to help ensure that logs reflect the latest state
                when debug breakpoints are hit. It is not recommended for
                production code.
