A `LogRecorder` implementation that maintains a set of daily rotating log
files, kept for a user-specified number of days.

**Important:** The `DailyRotatingLogFileRecorder` is expected to have full
control over the `directoryPath` with which it was instantiated. Any file not
explicitly known to be an active log file may be removed during the pruning
process. Therefore, be careful not to store anything in the `directoryPath`
that you wouldn't mind being deleted when pruning occurs.
