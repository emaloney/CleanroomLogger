# CleanroomASL Breaking Changes

Cleanroom Project frameworks adhere to [the semantic versioning system used by Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#version-requirement).

This system assigns version numbers with three independent integer values separated by periods:

    major.minor.patch

- When the *major version* is incremented, it reflects large-scale changes to the framework that are likely to introduce public API changes, possibly significant ones.
- An incremented the *minor version* usually signals additional functionality or minor rearchitecting, either of which *may* bring changes to the public API.
- An incremented *patch version* signals bugfixes and/or cleanup, but should **not** signal breaking API changes. (If a breaking change is made to the public API in a patch release, it is unintentional and should be considered a bug.)

## 1.1.0

1. The dependency on CleanroomBase has been removed. As a result, `CleanroomASL.xcodeproj` will no longer build `CleanroomBase.framework`. If your project references `CleanroomBase.framework` solely as a result of a previous version of CleanroomASL, you may safely remove it. Otherwise, if your project continues to use CleanroomBase, [you will need to integrate with it directly](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomBase/blob/master/INTEGRATION.md).

## 1.2.0

This release uses a pre-release version 2.0 of the Swift language, and therefore requires specific _beta_ versions of Xcode 7 that are no longer supplied by Apple.

As a result, the 1.2.x release line is no longer supported.

## 1.3.0

This release uses Swift 2.0 and requires a release version of Xcode 7.

This release also adds support for tvOS.
