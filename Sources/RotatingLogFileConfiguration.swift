    /**
     Initializes a new `RotatingLogFileConfiguration` instance.

     - warning: The `RotatingLogFileRecorder` created by this configuration
     assumes full control over the log directory specified as `directoryPath`.
     Any file not recognized as an active log file will be deleted during the
     automatic pruning process, which may occur at any time. Therefore, be
     __extremely careful__ when constructing the value passed in as the
     `directoryPath`.

     - parameter minimumSeverity: The minimum supported `LogSeverity`. Any
     `LogEntry` having a `severity` less than `minimumSeverity` will be silently
     ignored by the configuration.
     
     - parameter daysToKeep: The number of days for which log files should be
     retained.

     - parameter directoryPath: The filesystem path of the directory where the
     log files will be stored. Please note the warning above regarding the
     `directoryPath`.

     - parameter synchronousMode: Determines whether synchronous mode will be
     used by the underlying `RotatingLogFileRecorder`. Synchronous mode is
     helpful while debugging, as it ensures that logs are always up-to-date
     when debug breakpoints are hit. However, synchronous mode can have a 
     negative influence on performance and is therefore not recommended for
     use in production code.

     - parameter filters: The `LogFilter`s to use when deciding whether a given
     `LogEntry` should be passed along for recording.

     - parameter formatters: An array of `LogFormatter`s to use for formatting
     log entries to be recorded by the receiver. Each formatter is consulted in
     sequence, and the formatted string returned by the first formatter to
     yield a non-`nil` value will be recorded. If every formatter returns `nil`,
     the log entry is silently ignored and not recorded.
     
     - parameter maximumFileSize: The approximate maximum size (in bytes) to allow log files to grow.
     If a log file is larger than this value after a log statement is appended, then the log file is rolled.
